the federalist papers is collection of articles and essays written by alexander hamilton james madison and john jay under the collective pseudonym publius to promote the ratification of the constitution of the united states the collection was commonly known as the federalist until the name the federalist papers emerged in the twentieth century the first seventy seven of these essays were published serially in the independent journal the new york packet and the daily advertiser between october and april compilation of these essays and eight others were published in two volumes as the federalist collection of essays written in favour of the new constitution as agreed upon by the federal convention september by publishing firm amp mclean in march and may the last eight papers nos were republished in the new york newspapers between june and august the authors of the federalist intended to influence the voters to ratify the constitution in federalist no they explicitly set that debate in broad political terms it has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country by their conduct and example to decide the important question whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force in federalist no madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates large commercial republic this is complemented by federalist no in which madison takes the measure of the united states declares it appropriate for an extended republic and concludes with memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the federal convention in federalist no hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the constitution by adding bill of rights insisting that the various provisions in the proposed constitution protecting liberty amount to bill of rights federalist no also written by hamilton lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts federalist no presents hamilton case for one man chief executive in federalist no madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called federalism in federalist no madison distills arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as the greatest of all reflections on human nature according to historian richard morris the essays that make up the federalist papers are an incomparable exposition of the constitution classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later american writer on june the proposed constitution was ratified by the minimum of nine states required under article vii in late july with eleven states having ratified the new constitution the process of organizing the new government began history origins the federal convention constitutional convention sent the proposed constitution to the confederation congress which in turn submitted it to the states for ratification at the end of september on september cato first appeared in the new york press criticizing the proposition brutus followed on october these and other articles and public letters critical of the new constitution would eventually become known as the anti federalist papers in response alexander hamilton decided to launch measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed constitution to the people of the state of new york he wrote in federalist no that the series would endeavor to give satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance that may seem to have any claim to your attention hamilton recruited collaborators for the project he enlisted john jay who after four essays federalist nos and fell ill and contributed only one more essay federalist no to the series jay also distilled his case into pamphlet in the spring of an address to the people of the state of new york hamilton cited it approvingly in federalist no james madison present in new york as virginia delegate to the confederation congress was recruited by hamilton and jay and became hamilton primary collaborator gouverneur morris and william duer were also considered however morris turned down the invitation and hamilton rejected three essays written by duer duer later wrote in support of the three federalist authors under the name philo publius meaning either friend of the people or friend of hamilton based on hamilton pen name publius hamilton chose the pseudonymous name publius while many other pieces representing both sides of the constitutional debate were written under roman names historian albert furtwangler contends that publius was cut above caesar or brutus or even cato publius valerius helped found the ancient republic of rome his more famous name publicola meant friend of the people hamilton had applied this pseudonym to three letters in in which he attacked fellow federalist samuel chase and revealed that chase had taken advantage of knowledge gained in congress to try to dominate the flour market authorship at the time of publication the authors of the federalist papers attempted to hide their identities due to hamilton and madison having attended the convention astute observers however correctly discerned the identities of hamilton madison and jay establishing authorial authenticity of the essays that constitute the federalist papers has not always been clear after hamilton death in list emerged claiming that he alone had written two thirds of the federalist essays some believe that several of these essays were written by madison nos and the scholarly detective work of douglass adair in postulated the following assignments of authorship corroborated in by computer analysis of the text in six months total of articles were written by the three men hamilton who had been leading advocate of national constitutional reform throughout the and was one of the three representatives for new york at the constitutional convention in became the first secretary of the treasury post he held until his resignation in madison who is now acknowledged as the father of the constitution despite his repeated rejection of this honor during his lifetime became leading member of the house of representatives from virginia secretary of state and ultimately the fourth president of the united states john jay who had been secretary for foreign affairs under the articles of confederation from through their expiration in became the first chief justice of the united states in stepping down in to accept election as governor of new york post he held for two terms retiring in publication the federalist articles appeared in three new york newspapers the independent journal the new york packet and the daily advertiser beginning on october although written and published with haste the federalist articles were widely read and greatly influenced the shape of american political institutions hamilton madison and jay published the essays at rapid pace at times three to four new essays by publius appeared in the papers in single week garry wills observes that this fast pace of production overwhelmed any possible response who given ample time could have answered such battery of arguments and no time was given hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essays in newspapers outside new york state and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place however they were only irregularly published outside new york and in other parts of the country they were often overshadowed by local writers because the essays were initially published in new york most of them begin with the same salutation to the people of the state of new york the high demand for the essays led to their publication in more permanent form on january the new york publishing firm amp mclean announced that they would publish the first essays as bound volume that volume was released on march and was titled the federalist volume new essays continued to appear in the newspapers federalist no was the last number to appear first in that form on april second bound volume was released on may containing federalist nos and the previously unpublished nos the last eight papers nos were republished in the new york newspapers between june and august french edition ended the collective anonymity of publius announcing that the work had been written by mm hamilton maddisson gay citoyens de état de new york in george hopkins published an american edition that similarly named the authors hopkins wished as well that the name of the writer should be prefixed to each number but at this point hamilton insisted that this was not to be and the division of the essays among the three authors remained secret the first publication to divide the papers in such way was an edition that used list left by hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled works of hamilton in jacob gideon published new edition with new listing of authors based on list provided by madison the difference between hamilton list and madison formed the basis for dispute over the authorship of dozen of the essays both hopkins and gideon editions incorporated significant edits to the text of the papers themselves generally with the approval of the authors in henry dawson published containing the original text of the papers arguing that they should be preserved as they were written in that particular historical moment not as edited by the authors years later modern scholars generally use the text prepared by jacob cooke for his edition of the federalist this edition used the newspaper texts for essay numbers and the mclean edition for essay numbers disputed essays while the authorship of of the federalist essays is fairly certain the identities of those who wrote the twelve remaining essays are disputed by some scholars the modern consensus is that madison wrote essays nos with nos being products of collaboration between him and hamilton no was by john jay the first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by hamilton who in the days before his ultimately fatal gun duel with aaron burr provided his lawyer with list detailing the author of each number this list credited hamilton with full of the essays three of those being jointly written with madison almost three quarters of the whole and was used as the basis for an printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays madison did not immediately dispute hamilton list but provided his own list for the gideon edition of the federalist madison claimed essays for himself and he suggested that the difference between the two lists was owing doubtless to the hurry in which hamilton memorandum was made out known error in hamilton list hamilton incorrectly ascribed no to john jay when in fact jay wrote no provided some evidence for madison suggestion statistical analysis has been undertaken on several occasions in attempts to accurately identify the author of each individual essay after examining word choice and writing style studies generally agree that the disputed essays were written by james madison however there are notable exceptions maintaining that some of the essays which are now widely attributed to madison were in fact collaborative efforts influence on the ratification debates the federalist papers were written to support the ratification of the constitution specifically in new york whether they succeeded in this mission is questionable separate ratification proceedings took place in each state and the essays were not reliably reprinted outside of new york furthermore by the time the series was well underway number of important states had already ratified it for instance pennsylvania on december new york held out until july certainly the federalist was more important there than anywhere else but furtwangler argues that it could hardly rival other major forces in the ratification contests specifically these forces included the personal influence of well known federalists for instance hamilton and jay and anti federalists including governor george clinton further by the time new york came to vote ten states had already ratified the constitution and it had thus already passed only nine states had to ratify it for the new government to be established among them the ratification by virginia the tenth state placed pressure on new york to ratify in light of that furtwangler observes new york refusal would make that state an odd outsider only federalists were elected to new york ratification convention compared to the anti federalists delegates while new york did indeed ratify the constitution on july the lack of public support for pro constitution federalists has led historian john kaminski to suggest that the impact of the federalist on new york citizens was negligible as for virginia which ratified the constitution only at its convention on june hamilton writes in letter to madison that the collected edition of the federalist had been sent to virginia furtwangler presumes that it was to act as debater handbook for the convention there though he claims that this indirect influence would be dubious distinction probably of greater importance to the virginia debate in any case were george washington support for the proposed constitution and the presence of madison and edmund randolph the governor at the convention arguing for ratification structure and content in federalist no hamilton listed six topics to be covered in the subsequent articles furtwangler notes that as the series grew this plan was somewhat changed the fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the constitution and the institutions it mandated while the two last topics were merely touched on in the last essay the papers can be broken down by author as well as by topic at the start of the series all three authors were contributing the first papers are broken down as by hamilton five by madison and four by jay the rest of the series however is dominated by three long segments by single writer nos by hamilton nos by madison written while hamilton was in albany and no through the end by hamilton published after madison had left for virginia opposition to the bill of rights the federalist papers specifically federalist no are notable for their opposition to what later became the united states bill of rights the idea of adding bill of rights to the constitution was originally controversial because the constitution as written did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people alexander hamilton the author of federalist no feared that such an enumeration once written down explicitly would later be interpreted as list of the only rights that people had however hamilton opposition to bill of rights was far from universal robert yates writing under the pseudonym brutus articulated this view point in the so called anti federalist no asserting that government unrestrained by such bill could easily devolve into tyranny references in the federalist and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny the federalist begins and ends with this issue in the final paper hamilton offers lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the union and ought to put them on their guard against hazarding anarchy civil war perpetual alienation of the states from each other and perhaps the military despotism of successful demagogue the matter was further clarified by the ninth amendment judicial use federal judges when interpreting the constitution frequently use the federalist papers as contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers they have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs in hines davidowitz to the validity of ex post facto laws in the decision calder bull apparently the first decision to mention the federalist the federalist had been quoted times in supreme court decisions the amount of deference that should be given to the federalist papers in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial as early as chief justice john marshall noted in the famous case mcculloch maryland that the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed to be entitled to great respect in expounding the constitution no tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government right to judge of their correctness must be retained in letter to thomas ritchie in james madison stated of the constitution that the legitimate meaning of the instrument must be derived from the text itself or if key is to be sought elsewhere it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the body which planned amp proposed the constitution but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective state conventions where it recd all the authority which it possesses complete list the colors used to highlight the rows

agronomy generally known as agriculture is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food fuel fiber chemicals recreation or land conservation agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics plant physiology meteorology and soil science it is the application of combination of sciences such as biology chemistry economics ecology earth science and genetics professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists history early humans practiced hunter gathering but by around bce they began to domesticate plants like wheat barley and rice this laid the foundation for agriculture ancient civilizations such as the sumerians egyptians and romans made significant advances in farming they introduced irrigation systems crop rotation and early forms of fertilization during this period agricultural knowledge remained relatively static in europe though islamic scholars made advances in agronomy ibn al awwam th century andalusian agronomist wrote the kitāb al filāḥa comprehensive guide on farming practices crop management and soil conservation the renaissance saw renewed interest in scientific exploration including agriculture leonardo da vinci and other scholars contributed to early agronomic theory studying plant growth crop rotation and animal husbandry agronomy emerged as distinct scientific discipline in the driven by advancements in chemistry and biology the development of scientific methods led to the study of plant physiology soil chemistry and the role of fertilizers in crop production justus von liebig german chemist made groundbreaking discoveries about plant nutrition establishing that plants require specific minerals such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for growth in the early th century began transforming agriculture mechanization the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and improved crop varieties led to higher agricultural productivity the green revolution led by scientists like norman borlaug introduced high yield crop varieties and modern farming techniques helping to avert hunger in many parts of the world by the late same century concerns over the environmental impact of industrial agriculture such as soil degradation water pollution and biodiversity loss led to push toward sustainable agriculture today agronomy continues to adapt to challenges of climate change global food security and the need to balance productivity with environmental stewardship plant breeding this topic of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops for various conditions plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops including corn soybeans and wheat it has also resulted in the development of new types of plants for example hybrid grain named triticale was produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat agronomy has also been instrumental for fruit and vegetable production research furthermore the application of plant breeding for turfgrass development has resulted in reduction in the demand for fertilizer and water inputs requirements as well as turf types with higher disease resistance biotechnology agronomists use biotechnology to extend and expedite the development of desired characteristics biotechnology is often laboratory activity requiring field testing of new crop varieties that are developed in addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is being applied increasingly for novel uses other than food for example oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils but it can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents substitute fuels and petrochemicals soil science agronomists study sustainable ways to make soils more productive and profitable they classify soils and analyze them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital for plant growth common macronutrients analyzed include compounds of nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulfur soil is also assessed for several micronutrients like zinc and boron the percentage of organic matter soil ph and nutrient holding capacity cation exchange capacity are tested in regional laboratory agronomists will interpret these laboratory reports and make recommendations to modify soil nutrients for optimal plant growth soil conservation additionally agronomists develop methods to preserve soil and decrease the effects of erosion by wind and water for example technique known as contour plowing may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall researchers of agronomy also seek ways to use the soil more effectively for solving other problems such problems include the disposal of human and animal manure water pollution and pesticide accumulation in the soil as well as preserving the soil for future generations such as the burning of paddocks after crop production pasture management techniques include no till farming planting of soil binding grasses along contours on steep slopes and using contour drains of depths as much as metre agroecology agroecology is the management of agricultural systems with an emphasis on ecological and environmental applications this topic is associated closely with work for sustainable agriculture organic farming and alternative food systems and the development of alternative cropping systems theoretical modeling theoretical production ecology is the quantitative study of the growth of crops the plant is treated as kind of biological factory which processes light carbon dioxide water and nutrients into harvestable products the main parameters are temperature sunlight standing crop biomass plant production distribution and nutrient and water supply
scientific visualization also spelled scientific visualisation is an branch of science concerned with the visualization of scientific phenomena it is also considered subset of computer graphics branch of computer science the purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand illustrate and glean insight from their data research into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information history one of the earliest examples of three dimensional scientific visualisation was maxwell thermodynamic surface sculpted in clay in by james clerk maxwell this prefigured modern scientific visualization techniques that use computer graphics notable early two dimensional examples include the flow map of napoleon march on moscow produced by charles joseph minard in the coxcombs used by florence nightingale in as part of campaign to improve sanitary conditions in the british army and the dot map used by john snow in to visualise the broad street cholera outbreak data visualization methods criteria for classifications two dimensional data sets scientific visualization using computer graphics gained in popularity as graphics matured primary applications were scalar fields and vector fields from computer simulations and also measured data the primary methods for visualizing two dimensional scalar fields are color mapping and drawing contour lines vector fields are visualized using glyphs and streamlines or line integral convolution methods tensor fields are often resolved to vector field by using one of the two eigenvectors to represent the tensor each point in the field and then visualized using vector field visualization methods three dimensional data sets for scalar fields the primary methods are volume rendering and isosurfaces methods for visualizing vector fields include glyphs graphical icons such as arrows streamlines and streaklines particle tracing line integral convolution lic and topological methods later visualization techniques such as were developed to visualize and tensor fields topics computer animation computer animation is the art technique and science of creating moving images via the use of computers it is becoming more common to be created by means of computer graphics though computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic low bandwidth and faster real time rendering needs sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself but sometimes the target is another medium such as film it is also referred to as cgi computer generated imagery or computer generated imaging especially when used in films applications include medical animation which is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients computer simulation computer simulation is computer program or network of computers that attempts to simulate an abstract model of particular system computer simulations have become useful part of mathematical modelling of many natural systems in physics and computational physics chemistry and biology human systems in economics psychology and social science and in the process of engineering and new technology to gain insight into the operation of those systems or to observe their behavior the simultaneous visualization and simulation of system is called visulation computer simulations vary from computer programs that run few minutes to network based groups of computers running for hours to ongoing simulations that run for months the scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible or perhaps even imaginable using the traditional paper and pencil mathematical modeling over years ago desert battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of tanks trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around kuwait using multiple supercomputers in the dod high performance computing modernization program information visualization information visualization is the study of the visual representation of large scale collections of non numerical information such as files and lines of code in software systems library and bibliographic databases networks of relations on the internet and so forth information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see explore and understand large amounts of information at once the key difference between scientific visualization and information visualization is that information visualization is often applied to data that is not generated by scientific inquiry some examples are graphical representations of data for business government news and social media interface technology and perception interface technology and perception shows how new interfaces and better understanding of underlying perceptual issues create new opportunities for the scientific visualization community surface rendering rendering is the process of generating an image from model by means of computer programs the model is description of three dimensional objects in strictly defined language or data structure it would contain geometry viewpoint texture lighting and shading information the image is digital image or raster graphics image the term may be by analogy with an artist rendering of scene rendering is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in video editing file to produce final video output important rendering techniques are volume rendering volume rendering is technique used to display projection of discretely sampled data set typical data set is group of slice images acquired by ct or mri scanner usually these are acquired in regular pattern one slice every millimeter and usually have regular number of image pixels in regular pattern this is an example of regular volumetric grid with each volume element or voxel represented by single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel volume visualization according to rosenblum volume visualization examines set of techniques that allows viewing an object without mathematically representing the other surface initially used in medical imaging volume visualization has become an essential technique for many sciences portraying phenomena become an essential technique such as clouds water flows and molecular and biological structure many volume visualization algorithms are computationally expensive and demand large data storage advances in hardware and software are generalizing volume visualization as well as real time performances developments of web based technologies and in browser rendering have allowed of simple volumetric presentation of cuboid with changing frame of reference to show volume mass and density data applications this section will give series of examples how scientific visualization can be applied today in the natural sciences star formation the featured plot is volume plot of the logarithm of gas dust density in an enzo star and galaxy simulation regions of high density are white while less dense regions are more blue and also more transparent gravitational waves researchers used the globus toolkit to harness the power of multiple supercomputers to simulate the gravitational effects of black hole collisions massive star supernovae explosions in the image three dimensional radiation hydrodynamics calculations of massive star supernovae explosions the djehuty stellar evolution code was used to calculate the explosion of sn model in three dimensions molecular rendering visit general plotting capabilities were used to create the molecular rendering shown in the featured visualization the original data was taken from the protein data bank and turned into vtk file before rendering in geography and ecology terrain visualization visit can read several file formats common in the field of geographic information systems gis allowing one to plot raster data such as terrain data in visualizations the featured image shows plot of dem dataset containing mountainous areas near dunsmuir ca elevation lines are added to the plot to help delineate changes in elevation tornado simulation this image was created from data generated by tornado simulation calculated on ncsa ibm computing cluster high definition television animations of the storm produced at ncsa were included in an episode of the pbs television series nova called hunt for the supertwister the tornado is shown by spheres that are colored according to pressure orange and blue tubes represent the rising and falling airflow around the tornado climate visualization this visualization depicts the carbon dioxide from various sources that are advected individually as tracers in the atmosphere model carbon dioxide from the ocean is shown as plumes during february atmospheric anomaly in times square in the image the results from the samrai simulation framework of an atmospheric anomaly in and around times square are visualized in mathematics scientific visualization of mathematical structures has been undertaken for purposes of building intuition and for aiding the forming of mental models higher dimensional objects can be visualized in form of projections views in lower dimensions in particular dimensional objects are visualized by means of projection in three dimensions the lower dimensional projections of higher dimensional objects can be used for purposes of virtual object manipulation allowing objects to be manipulated by operations performed in and objects by interactions performed in in complex analysis functions of the complex plane are inherently dimensional but there is no natural geometric projection into lower dimensional visual representations instead colour vision is exploited to capture dimensional information using techniques such as domain coloring in the formal sciences computer mapping of topographical surfaces through computer mapping of topographical surfaces mathematicians can test theories of how materials will change when stressed the imaging is part of the work on the nsf funded electronic visualization laboratory at the university of illinois at chicago curve plots visit can plot curves from data read from files and it can be used to extract and plot curve data from higher dimensional datasets using lineout operators or queries the curves in the featured image correspond to elevation data along lines drawn on dem data and were created with the feature lineout capability lineout allows you to interactively draw line which specifies path for data extraction the resulting data was then plotted as curves image annotations the featured plot shows leaf area index lai measure of global vegetative matter from netcdf dataset the primary plot is the large plot at the bottom which shows the lai for the whole world the plots on top are actually annotations that contain images generated earlier image annotations can be used to include material that enhances visualization such as auxiliary plots images of experimental data project logos etc scatter plot visit scatter plot allows visualizing multivariate data of up to four dimensions the scatter plot takes multiple scalar variables and uses them for different axes in phase space the different variables are combined to form coordinates in the phase space and they are displayed using glyphs and colored using another scalar variable in the applied sciences porsche

the gens mamilia was plebeian family at ancient rome during the period of the republic the gens was originally one of the most distinguished families of tusculum and indeed in the whole of latium it is first mentioned in the time of the tarquins and it was to member of this family octavius mamilius that lucius tarquinius superbus the seventh and last king of rome betrothed his daughter the gens obtained roman citizenship in the th century bc and some of its members must subsequently have settled at rome where lucius mamilius vitulus became the first of the family to hold the consulship in bc the year before the first punic war origin the mamilii traced their nomen and origin to the mythical mamilia the daughter of telegonus who was regarded as the legendary founder of tusculum and the son of ulysses and the goddess circe this origin was referred to on coin of the gens the obverse of which depicts the head of mercury or hermes the ancestor of ulysses and the reverse ulysses himself clad in the humble disguise he assumed to avoid being recognized by the suitors of penelope praenomina the earliest of the mamilii to occur in history bore the praenomen octavius which was rare at rome his descendants used the praenomina lucius quintus gaius and marcus all of which were very common names throughout roman history branches and cognomina the mamilii were divided into three families with the cognomina limetanus turrinus and vitulus of which the two latter were the most ancient and important limetanus is the only surname which occurs on coins vitulus was surname in both the mamilia and voconia gentes niebuhr supposes that vitulus is merely another form of italus and remarks that we find in the same manner in the mamilia gens the surname turrinus that is tyrrhenus an etruscan it was customary as is proved by the oldest roman fasti for the great houses to take distinguishing surnames from people with whom they were connected by blood or by the ties of public hospitality the ancients however connected the surname vitulus with the latin word signifying calf which was depicted on coin of one of the voconii vituli although the connection of turrinus and tyrrhenus is by no means impossible or even unlikely it could also have been derived from turris tower an ancient tower known as the turris mamilia stood in the subura and figured in ritual battle between the residents of two neighborhoods at rome for the head of the october horse

the east west line ewl is high capacity mass rapid transit mrt line operated by smrt in singapore running from pasir ris station in the east to tuas link station in the west with an additional branch between changi airport and tanah merah stations it is the second mass rapid transit line to be built in singapore coloured green on the rail map the line serves stations of which from lavender to tiong bahru and changi airport stations are underground at the line is the longest on the mrt network constructed and opened as part of the north south line nsl in the early stages of development the east west line was the second rail line formed in singapore after nsl with the opening of the eastern extension to tanah merah on the ewl in nevertheless both lines use identical signalling equipment and rolling stock the east west line signalling systems have been upgraded along with the north south line with both mrt lines having its signalling fully upgraded converting it from semi automatic to fully automatic history initial developments the first segment of what would become the east west line between city hall and outram park stations was opened on december as part of the north south line and phase of the initial system subsequently it was extended westwards to clementi station on march and to lakeside on november the eastern extension to tanah merah station opened on november which also marked the start of independent operations as the east west line the opening ceremony was attended by then first deputy prime minister goh chok tong the line extension to pasir ris station was opened ahead of schedule on december with sneak preview beforehand boon lay station opened on july marking the completion of the initial mrt system subsequent developments dover station construction on new infill station located between buona vista station and clementi station namely dover station began in june it is the first station in the mrt network to be built as an infill station the building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over the small area it serviced and there were criticisms over the spending of taxpayers money chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution despite some opposition the land transport authority proceeded with the construction to serve commuters along singapore polytechnic with dover housing estate the station opened on october prior to opening test runs were conducted from to october when the trains stopped at the station but did not open their doors tanah merah to airport extension line the idea of extending the mass rapid transit system to changi airport was reconsidered when terminal of the airport was being built earlier plans had long been made for new line branching off from the existing east west line at tanah merah with some conceptual plans showing tentative route alignment up to the airport along airport boulevard continuing beyond the airport to changi point before turning southwest back towards the city along the eastern coasts the plans were finally announced by then deputy prime minister lee hsien loong on november however the new route alignment showed deviation from previous plans where the final plan involved in building only the first two stations of expo and changi airport the latter being the underground station built between terminal and terminal the alignment of the station at the airport also switched perpendicularly to an east west direction such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station the station designs were unveiled on february with construction starting on january expo and changi airport were opened on january and february respectively and operates under shuttle service prior to july train services from boon lay commences after the opening but were later reverted to shuttle services due to low patronage on may it was announced that the changi airport extension will be converted to become part of thomson east coast line extension tele by boon lay and tuas extension the boon lay extension was first announced by the lta on december set to serve residents from the jurong west town area and those working in the jurong industrial estate the two stations pioneer and joo koon stations officially opened on february on january the tuas west extension an extension of the east west line from joo koon to tuas link was announced the extension has span of which spans twin tracked mrt viaduct four above ground stations and depot to provide stabling and maintenance facilities for the additional trains that will be bought for the extension and to cater for future expansion of the line the viaduct is integrated with part of road viaduct along pioneer road which will increase the road capacity to cope with anticipated increase in traffic the stations are gul circle tuas crescent tuas west road and tuas link on may the land transport authority marked the start of construction of the tuas west extension with groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the future tuas link station the extension began service on june during initial stages after opening the westbound trains will alternate their terminus between joo koon and tuas link where for every two trains one train will terminate at the former while the other train will terminate at the latter additional platform at tanah merah station on august the land transport authority announced that new platform will be constructed at tanah merah enabling faster travel and shorter waiting times for commuters heading towards expo and changi airport on the changi airport branch line of the east west line on october the land transport authority awarded the civil contract to lum chang building contractors pte ltd to build new platform at tanah merah and viaducts for contract sum of million in addition to the new platforms the existing east west line tracks will be extended to connect the line to the new four in one east coast integrated depot at changi when completed in it will be the second station to have triple island platforms after jurong east half height platform screen door installations there were calls for platform screen doors psds to be installed at above ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed or seriously injured by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above ground stations underground stations already featured the doors since the authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs but made an about turn later with the government announcing plans to install half height platform screen doors on the elevated stations on january citing lower costs due to it becoming more common feature worldwide they were first installed at jurong east pasir ris and yishun stations in as trial runs on august the lta announced completion of the installation of psds along the east west line with expo being the last station on the line to receive the psds installation of psds across both the north south and east west lines nsewl were completed on march months ahead of schedule improvement works timber to concrete sleeper replacement works the timber sleepers on the east west line was required to be replaced as they were near the end of their year lifespan the replacement sleepers made of concrete have significantly longer lifespan to speed up works train services on the east west line was adjusted to end earlier the work was divided into three phases phase bugis tanah merah phase joo koon jurong east tanah merah pasir ris and phase jurong east outram park the sleepers were fully replaced on february re signalling works new moving block signalling system supplied by thales replaced the former ageing fixed block signalling system on the east west line the new signalling system costing million reduces waiting times for trains during peak periods from seconds then to seconds now the new system became operational between pioneer and tuas link stations on june newer rolling stocks such as the and are equipped for use solely on the new signalling system since may the new signalling system has been operating full day on the entire east west line third rail replacement replacement works on the third rail which provides electricity to the trains were carried out between september and august the new third rail replaced its year old predecessor and is expected to increase reliability of the east west line electrical system pasir ris turnback extension new railway turnback located at pasir ris station the eastern terminus of the line was announced by the land transport authority on jun it would extend the railway viaduct past the station by the turnback will allow for an increase in service frequency during peak times from to trains per hour as trains will be able to change directions faster to head westwards on the line to meet future increases in ridership demand construction started in and was completed in may incidents clementi train collision on august before opening maintenance vehicle spilt oil on the tracks between clementi and jurong east the first ten eastbound trains reported braking problems then the eleventh train from jurong stopped at the clementi station for two minutes longer than scheduled due to it using its emergency brakes to stop at the station at am before being hit by another eastbound train when it failed to stop in time passengers were injured by the collision july power trip during the evening peak hours on july train services on the east west and north south lines were temporarily disrupted due to massive power trips detected along both

fine of million on smrt march staff fatalities at about on march two smrt track maintenance trainee staff were run over and killed by train approaching pasir ris station resulting in temporarily service delay between tanah merah and pasir ris for over two hours that affected at least commuters the two trainee staff had joined smrt in january and worked as technicians under technical team of staff led by supervisor and were tasked to go down to the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by possible signalling equipment fault close by the station an operator cited that they were granted access to the tracks but did not coordinate with signal unit in the station to ensure trains could not travel in the area where the team was patrick nathan smrt vice president promised that smrt will review all safety protocols particularly those involving track access smrt chief executive desmond kuek apologised for the incident and said smrt will investigate how the two men got hit by the train smrt fired both an engineer responsible for leading with the team and the train driver who was involved at the scene of the incident the engineer who led the inspection team was charged with

staff were hospitalized train services between tuas link and joo koon stations were temporally suspended in both directions for two hours on the day itself and the entire day on november and westbound trains temporarily terminated at joo koon an update by the land transport authority lta amp smrt on november stated that lta and smrt had decided to isolate for up to one month the operations of the tuas west extension which runs on the new signalling system from the rest of the east west line which runs on the old signalling system enabling lta engineers to carry out further assurance checks together with thales the train was switching systems when the collision took place train service on the line resumed on november with the tuas west extension between gul circle and tuas link using the new signalling system and the section between pasir ris and joo koon together with the changi airport branch continuing to run on the old signalling system train services between joo koon and gul circle were temporarily suspended until its resumption on may between the suspension free bridging bus service is available between the two stations continuous service between pasir ris and gul circle resumed on may with the permanent activation of the new cbtc system since the incident selected portions of either the north south line or east west line were closed to conduct track renewal works with early weekend closures and later station openings september train derailment and disruptions train services between boon lay and queenstown had been suspended since am on september after trains lost power on stretch near clementi mrt station defective train axle box on one of the first generation trains which had been deadheading to ulu pandan depot after it was withdrawn at clementi station dropped onto the tracks near dover station and caused the wheels of bogie an undercarriage to come off the running rail and hit track equipment including stretches of the third rail point machines as well as power cables and rail clips in an update at about pm on september lta and smrt announced that train services between buona vista and jurong east would remain suspended on september the st day

approximately am to around midnight daily in general during peak hours train frequency is to minutes while during non peak hours the frequency is reduced to minutes throughout the entire route the first train departs from these places train services on the east west line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works usually on selected fridays saturdays or sundays shuttle bus services may be provided throughout the duration of the early closures and late openings for affected commuters operations of the east west line are affected by the covid pandemic leading to the drop of ridership route as its name implies the east west line connects central singapore to both eastern and western parts of the island with an additional branch between changi airport and tanah merah which operates as separate shuttle service it is kilometers miles long and it is predominantly double tracked but certain short sections at tanah merah outram park and joo koon widens to three tracks four tracks nearby jurong east station and section between jurong east and clementi station and five tracks nearby changi depot and tanah merah station some stations are commonly placed at the middle of the roads such as tanah merah bedok queenstown commonwealth dover clementi pioneer joo koon gul circle tuas crescent and tuas west road the line runs mostly on overhead viaducts but goes underground in the city area between kallang and redhill bedok and kembangan and between expo and changi airport travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about minutes the line begins above ground at pasir ris station from where it continues to head south towards simei station the line curves between simei to tanah merah stations and continues westwards joining the changi airport branch paralleling new upper changi road two branch lines to changi depot and to changi airport station exists between simei and tanah merah stations at tanah merah station the line extends to four tracks due to its interchange with the changi branch before turning back into two tracks in western direction from bedok station to kembangan station the line goes underground but then goes above ground and follows the route of sims avenue and sims avenue east in an opposite direction after kallang station the line goes underground through the central area and runs heads south west towards city hall station it then runs parallel to the north south line between city hall and raffles place stations which are cross platform interchanges to the north south line after tanjong pagar the line curves northwestwards towards outram park after tiong bahru the line continues above ground starting with redhill station and follows the direction of commonwealth avenue commonwealth avenue west and boon lay way between clementi and jurong east station three branches one going east and two going west to ulu pandan depot are deployed at jurong east station the line extends again to four tracks due to its interchange with the north south line but then separates into two before heading west to chinese garden station after pioneer station the line heads south west before curving westwards towards joo koon station the line terminates at tuas link with branch heading towards tuas depot the changi airport extension starts at tanah merah station as single track before turning eastwards to expo station after expo station it goes underground and curves south before terminating at changi airport station the east west line was constructed along the north south line as such both lines used identical signalling equipment and rolling stock stations the line serves stations across of track and station codes for the line are green corresponding to the line colour on the system map stations including changi airport and other stations on the stretch from lavender to tiong bahru are underground with the rest being elevated with the exception of dover all stations have island platforms legend list smrt used to operate the branch sector of tanah merah to changi airport as through service from boon lay from november until july when it was replaced with shuttle service by the changi airport line cal will be converted to the thomson east coast line infrastructure rolling stock five batches of rolling stock operate on the east west line namely the and from oldest to newest shared with the north south line trains are maintained at changi depot ulu pandan depot and tuas depot which provide train maintenance inspection and overhaul facilities these models of rolling stock were introduced to boost the capacity on both the north south and the east west lines in order to cope with increasing ridership both the north south and the east west lines utilized identical rolling stock up until the when the trains were temporary suspended from operating on the north south line from january until november following the train disruptions the trains which were introduced in april did not begin revenue service on the full stretch of the east west line until the line trial of the cbtc signalling system in may the trains despite their introduction on september on the north south line rarely run on the east west line another generation of rolling stock the trains will be delivered from to to replace all first generation trains which will be retired by as well as all second generation and third generation trains which were fully phased out by the trains are the first rolling stock on the east west line to be manufactured by bombardier bought by alstom in which has also supplied trains for the downtown line the first train entered service on the east west line on june signalling the east west line is equipped with thales seltrac communications based train control cbtc moving block

pioneer and joo koon support mixed mode of both signalling systems trains terminating at either joo koon or tuas link would have to change signalling modes at pioneer mrt station as trains terminating at joo koon would proceed to turn back siding which was built as part of the twe which only supports the new signalling system eastbound trains towards pasir ris would have to change back to the old signalling system at pioneer mrt station this procedure was removed after the train collision at joo koon as trains terminated at joo koon the new signalling system became fully operational on may platform screen doors when the line was first opened full height platform screen doors supplied by westinghouse were installed at underground stations these doors serve to prevent suicides enable climate control within the station better security control by restricting access to the tunnels and tracks and for overall passenger safety considerations the authorities initially rejected calls for platform screen doors to be installed at elevated stations by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs nevertheless the lta reversed its decision and made plans to install half height platform screen doors on elevated stations on january the first platform screen doors by st electronics were installed at pasir ris jurong east and yishun stations in as trial runs subsequently installation began in may at ang mo kio station on the north south line on march platform screen doors became operational at all elevated stations on the east west line stations

canada alberta has single tier system of municipal government similar to that of most of the other provinces lieutenant governor of canada is also the sovereign for alberta provincial jurisdiction within canada the monarch exercises power individually on behalf of the federal government and the provinces the powers of the crown are vested in the monarch and are exercised by the lieutenant governor while the advice of the premier and executive council is typically binding on the lieutenant governor there are occasions when the lieutenant governor has refused advice this usually occurs if the premier does not clearly command the confidence of the elected legislative assembly or if the advice or legislation would be in lieutenant governor salma lakhani identified the constitutional role of the lieutenant governor as the most important part of the job she stated we are constitutional monarchy and this is where we do checks and balances what would call constitutional fire extinguisher we don have to use it lot but sometimes we do have to use it in response to proposed alberta sovereignty act if it was determined to be the proposed law would give the province the ability to ignore federal legislation it does not agree with legislative power the legislative assembly of alberta is the deliberative assembly of the alberta legislature for the province of alberta canada and is seated at the alberta legislature building in the provincial capital of edmonton the legislative assembly is unicameral assembly of members elected first past the post from single member

public service and directed by the elected government the premier of alberta is the primary minister of the crown the premier acts as the head of government for the province chairs and selects the membership of the cabinet and advises the crown on the exercise of executive power and much of the royal prerogative history of alberta politics provincial alberta parliamentary governments are determined by general elections held every three to five years five years is the maximum term allowed by elections are conducted between the general elections to fill seats left vacant by death or resignation in each election so far single party has taken majority of the seats although sometimes it does this after receiving less than half the votes cast alberta politics has historically been one of long lasting governments with government changes being few and far between for the first years alberta was province it had liberal government through the the growing farmer movement forced reforms out of this government and embodied in the united farmers of alberta group it launched itself into direct politics winning power in the first election it contested louise mckinney and roberta macadams were the first women elected to the legislative assembly in the election they were also the first women in any legislature of the british empire irene parlby was the first woman appointed to the provincial cabinet in alberta was swept up in the wave of prairie populism that took place after the first world war from to the united farmers of alberta headed the longest lived of the farmers governments that won power in canada during this time it made several reforms including changing alberta election system ranked voting was brought in single transferable voting proportional representation in the cities and instant runoff voting outside the cities the ufa lost all its seats in when william aberhart social credit party socred was elected on radical monetary reform platform after aberhart death in and changing economic conditions the socred government moved to the right under premier ernest manning for over years the province was governed by right of centre parties the socreds were succeeded in by the progressive conservatives ralph klein was premier of alberta from to and despite multiple controversies he remained the leader of the progressive conservative party and thus the province although only percent of delegates from his party signified their approval of his leadership on the spring of pushing him into retirement in the previous election klein pc party had taken less than half the votes cast in the province but had won percent of the seats left wing edmonton was an exception to the province post second world war conservative voting pattern earning it the nickname redmonton edmonton city residents to larger extent than elsewhere tend to vote for the liberal party of alberta and alberta new democrats their preferences is often obscured by the first past the post electoral system no labour or ccf or ndp candidate won an edmonton seat from to despite the large left vote in the city overall in part due to the cancellation of the stv irv voting systems in the provincial election was an example of how the city got its nickname redmonton liberal and new democrat candidates won of the city seats while tories won of edmonton seats in klein successor ed stelmach represented riding just outside edmonton and was perceived to be less connected to the interests of the energy corporations whose headquarters are in calgary stelmach gave way in to alison redford the province first female premier she led the tories to th consecutive election victory in redford was forced to resign in and was ultimately succeeded by former federal minister jim prentice the period of conservative dominance in alberta politics was broken in when the alberta new democratic party formed government for the first time and rachel notley became alberta th premier the ndp won of alberta seats the general election saw jason kenney and his new united conservative party merger of the progressive conservative and wildrose parties sweep to power the ucp won of seats in the alberta legislature returning the province to conservative politics this was the only election in alberta history to dethrone an incumbent government after only single term however the ucp received just percent of the vote the first past the post system inflating the avalanche of switched seats and exaggerating the appearance of the party popularity in the general election the ucp won another majority but by smaller margins ucp seats ndp seats ucp percent of votes ndp percent of votes cast overall federal when first mps were elected in what is present day alberta in calgary and southern alberta generally elected conservatives such as donald watson davis and north central alberta elected liberals such as frank oliver after province hood alberta federal representation mostly echoed that of its provincial government like provincial elections federal elections again and again saw the leading party no matter what its label receive more than its due share of members and the other parties were under represented when liberals were in power in the legislative assembly most of the province mps were liberal the election was an exception the union government use of the soldier vote meant that liberal candidates with majority support among voters voting in the riding were not declared elected then when the united farmers dominated from to most of the alberta mps were of that party calgary was labour stronghold and its election of two labour mps in was un equalled anywhere else in the country when social credit came into vogue winning its first electoral successes in federal representation also changed to being mostly socred the social credit party under ernest manning turned right wing in the but this apparently mirrored changing sentiment among alberta voters and the party maintained its power provincially and its hold on most of the federal seats until the alberta conservative leaning was pronounced on the federal level the province was the heartland of the reform party of canada and its successor the canadian alliance these parties were the second largest political parties in the federal parliament from to and they were located on the political right the canadian alliance merged with the progressive conservative party to form today conservative party of canada the conservatives former leader and ex prime minister stephen harper moved to alberta in the and represented calgary riding rona ambrose the party interim leader and leader of the opposition is also an albertan alberta elected no liberal mp to in it elected one in edmonton and one in calgary in it received percent of the alberta votes so was proportionally due five seats in that province in those years when alberta had no liberal mps liberals were in power to and to the present in almost all of those five periods for total of years alberta did not have direct representation in the federal cabinet this included the years when pm pierre trudeau tried to create national energy program it failed to this day canada is one of only few major countries without national energy plan the ccf never did elect an mp in alberta but under its later label the new democratic party the left has achieved more successes in alberta electing an mp in and one in edmonton strathcona every time since in an additional ndp mp was elected in edmonton griesbach the party received almost fifth of the alberta vote in and proportionally was due six seats rural alberta ridings typically give the leading party whether it is the conservatives or the united farmers social credit reform and the alliance before them some of the highest margins in the country in many cases the successful candidate receives more than two thirds of the vote provincial political culture alberta political stability has led to political continuity voters have turned government out of office only five times in years the two governments prior to were among the longest lived in the commonwealth since the end of stv irv in alberta elections have used the first past the post voting system so mlas elected do not necessarily receive majority of the votes in the constituency and the party with majority of the seats in the legislature does not necessarily receive majority of votes cast in the election for example in the election the progressive conservative party won of seats of the seats but obtained only of the popular vote during the ufa and early socred government periods elections were conducted using transferable preferential ballots see ranked voting members in cities ran in city wide districts under the single transferable voting system ensuring city wide proportional representation in the legislature members outside the cities were elected using instant runoff voting in the cities under stv balanced representation was elected while irv used elsewhere produced the same disproportional results that were produced before and after by first past the post no labour ccf or ndp members were elected in edmonton prior to except in elections where stv was used many of the opposition parties today include electoral reform in their policies in its history alberta has seen only six distinct governments with no party ever returning to form government under the same label again after defeat the ufa government of can be seen as precursor of the ndp government of as it was its forerunner the present ucp government is an organizational descendant of the old progressive conservative party that reigned from to all alberta elections have resulted in majority government trend unseen in any other canadian province but frequently the most popular party was the choice of less than half the voters even with crossing the floor or by elections alberta has never had minority government each government has held majority of seats in the legislature progressive conservative to ndp to ucp to present some albertans continue to resent the imposition in the of the national energy program nep by the liberal federal government of prime minister pierre trudeau it was considered to be an intrusion by the federal government in an area of provincial responsibility this led some albertans to advocate separation of the province from canada but this advocacy despite occasional surges in interest has never resulted in electoral success neither however has the liberal party of canada enjoyed much success in alberta outside of edmonton since that time the nep was ended when the progressive conservative party of canada led by brian mulroney formed the federal government following the federal election in the election the federal conservative party of canada won all the seats in alberta providing them with complete sweep of the province however the ndp won the seat of edmonton strathcona in the election of denying the conservatives sweep of the province in this election no alberta seats changed parties in the election in which the conservatives went from minority government to parliamentary majority in all three elections many of the conservative candidates were elected with large majorities of the vote alberta has for decades been considered conservative fortress no matter which right of centre party they may have chosen to support albertans followed strong support for the progressive conservatives in the with the same degree of support for the reform party and the canadian alliance in the finally delivering clean sweep for the new conservative party of canada only few years after its creation in however small disaffection with the conservative party of canada over policies enacted during its minority government such as equalization payments in canada and the conservatives reversal on income trusts led to the founding of the nascent federal party of alberta in provincially while the progressive conservative party of alberta had been in power for years they continued to win large majorities in the legislative assembly winning out of seats in the march provincial election although with declining popularity and lowering voter turn out reflecting increasing disfavour among ordinary albertans regarding the government market first policies its low quality of health and education services and its flat income tax policy as well for the first time since the the pcs faced challenge from the right wing the upstart wildrose alliance party november poll said the new party had support just points behind the governing pcs in polls the wildrose party had double digit lead over the pcs in december with versus each for the pcs and alberta liberals in april jim prentice called an election for may citing the need for mandate in order to make longer term economic changes though initial polls had the pcs in the lead as the election approached they fell behind the opposition wildrose party and the ndp on may the ndp gained seats winning majority government under rachel notley the united conservative party ucp was established in july as merger between the progressive conservative association of alberta and the wildrose party when established the ucp immediately formed the official opposition in the legislative assembly of alberta the party won majority mandate in the alberta general election to form the government of alberta in the election it lost several seats but maintained majority in the legislative assembly finance budget the budget contained billion deficit with billion in revenue and billion in expenditures the budget also contained million risk adjustment which was intended to reflect volatility of alberta resource revenue
in spoken language analysis an utterance is continuous piece of speech by one person before or after which there is silence on the part of the person in the case of spoken languages it is generally but not always bounded by silence in written language utterances only exist indirectly though their representations or portrayals they can be represented and delineated in written language in many ways in spoken language utterances have several characteristics such as paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as facial expression gesture and posture prosodic features include stress intonation and tone of voice as well as ellipsis which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps moreover other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non fluency features including voiced un voiced pauses umm tag questions and false starts or when someone begins uttering again to correct themselves other features include fillers and stuff accent dialect deictic expressions utterances such as over there that need further explanation to be understood simple conjunctions and but etc and colloquial lexis everyday informal words utterances that are represented or portrayed in writing are planned unlike utterances in improvised spoken language in written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language discourse structure which can also be found in spoken language is how the conversation is organized in which adjacency pairs an utterance and the answer to that utterance are used discourse markers are used to organize conversation first secondly etc lexis denotes the words being used in text or spoken these words can create semantic field for example semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore admire and care characteristics an utterance found in spoken or written language as in script has several characteristics these include paralinguistic features which are forms of communication that do not involve words but are added around an utterance to give meaning examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions laughter eye contact and gestures prosodic features refer to the sound of someone voice as they speak pitch intonation and stress ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language for instance when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation for example juice please room temperature cold non fluency features also occur when producing utterances as people think about what to say during conversations there are errors and corrections in speech for example voiced un voiced pauses which are umm erm etc in voiced pauses and in transcripts un voiced pauses are denoted as or relating to the amount of time of the pause tag questions are also part of non fluency features these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying an example is do you know what mean false alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again usually to correct themselves fillers usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance these include lexis such as like and stuff accent dialect is also characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world deictic expressions are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood like wow look over there simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like and but etc colloquial lexis is type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed child directed speech the development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents adults or any other guardian the child has growing up studies have indicated that this development is affected by the parent adult or guardian socioeconomic status ses it has been shown that children whose parents received more education and have higher ses have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood while children with less educated parents and lower ses have smaller vocabulary and slower growth in their vocabulary skills arriaga fenson cronan amp pethick hart amp risley hoff laursen amp tardif hoff ginsberg lawrence amp shipley ninio this correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexises when speaking to their children as opposed to parents who are less educated hart amp risley hoff huttenlocher vasilyeva waterfall vevea amp hedges in press hoff analysis supports this correlation and shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their ses status and thus child vocabulary development for instance high ses mothers use longer utterances and wider variety of words when talking to their children these mothers also spend more time talking to their children while low ses mothers use shorter utterances and smaller vocabulary as result children with parents who are more educated have larger vocabularies hoff in child directed speech utterances have several additional features for example the phonology in child directed speech is different utterances are spoken more slowly with longer pauses in between utterances higher pitches etc the lexis and semantics differ and speaker uses words suited for children doggie instead of dog for example the grammar is simpler repetitive with less use of verbs and adjectives there is greater use of one word utterances and the pragmatics uses supportive language like expansions and re casting gricean maxims paul grice came up with four maxims necessary in order to have collegial conversation in which utterances are understood bakhtin theory of utterance according to philosopher mikhail bakhtin there are four accepted properties that utterances should have bakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and sentence are not the same thing according to bakhtin sentences do not indicate change of speech subject and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances according to him the sentence as language unit is grammatical in nature while an utterance is ethical
